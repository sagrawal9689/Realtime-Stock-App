This repository contains two projects:

1. **Backend**: Located in the `stock-price-app-backend` folder, built with Node.js.
2. **Frontend**: Located in the `stock-price-app-frontend` folder, built with React.js.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js v16**: This is required for both the backend and frontend projects.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

To install the necessary Node modules, navigate to each project folder and run the installation command:

- **For the Backend**:

  ```bash
  cd stock-price-app-backend
  npm install
  ```

- **For the Frontend**:
  ```bash
  cd stock-price-app-frontend
  npm install
  ```

### 2. Running the Projects

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start both the backend and frontend projects. Open two terminal windows or tabs and run the following commands:

- **To Run the Backend**:

  ```bash
  cd stock-price-app-backend
  npm start
  ```

  The backend will be running on http://localhost:5000/.

- **To Run the Frontend**:

  ```

  The frontend will be running on http://localhost:3000/.

  Both servers must be running simultaneously for the application to function correctly.
